# WordpressApi - currently under development

A simple interface for accessing data sites via the Wordpress Rest API

## Why make this?
I scoured the earth looking for a simple way to access WordPress data via the WordPress Rest API and I was not happy with the results. Some libraries were either out of data or abandoed. 
Most were not extendadble. It was not possible to make use of custom post types nor custom authentication. Furthermore, I wanted something a far more OOP.

So here we are.
